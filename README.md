# 2. Network Troubleshooting Commands

ping

The ping command in Linux is used to test the connectivity between your system and another system (host) over a network. When you use ping with an IP address, it sends packets of data to that IP address and waits for a response. This helps you check if the target machine is reachable and measures the time it takes for the packets to travel back and forth
